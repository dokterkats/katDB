# katDB
***This is a database of game states for the Kat Walk C..***

## Explanation

There are several key factors in determining if a game or experience will work well on a KAT VR device. This database will list what I believe are the most essential factors. This includes how well the in-game walking speed matches your real-life speed. But also if the in-game world is big enough to actually walk in. Please also see this [(SteamVR List)](https://www.kat-vr.com/pages/all-gamelist), as well as the [(Oculus game list)](https://www.kat-vr.com/pages/oculus-game-list), provided by KAT VR

## Navigating katDB

* To view the CSV spreadsheet view it [here](./List.csv).

* To view game requests to test and contribute yourself, [go here](./requests.csv)

* To download custom katDB game configs, [go here.](./Game Configs)

**NOTE: as of now, kat DB is only for applications using the SteamVR platform. Games from the Oculus store arent listed yet.

## What Do The Ratings Mean?

1. Unusable. Mostly games that fail to work, or with no smooth locomotion
2. Acceptable, but with long latency or slow/unrealistic walking speeds 
3. Almost everything works with minimal caveats
4. Perfect or like-perfect experience

## How To Contribute Your Applications

### Testing Standards

- Only test games using the Kat Gateway. KatDB does not list game compatibilty with other platforms like Natural Locomotion or other treadmill platforms. 

This could change in the future. If you are interested in contributing for other platforms, please hit me up on Discord: Dokterkat#7493. You can also find me in the Kat VR Community Discord Group.

8. The game posses big open world/worlds.
9. The game has a low delay registering a walk.
10. The the game has a realistic walking speed.
