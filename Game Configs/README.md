# Custom Game Configs by Dokterkat

The reason why I also include some games that already have pre-set configurations, is that those games never seem to use the joystick(Press) functionality. <br>
<h3> Modified pre-set configs using joystick(Press):</h3> <br>
-Arizona Sunshine <br>
-Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond <br>
-Rec Room <br>
